SASS Installation Steps (macOS)

1. Verified Node.js and npm were installed
   $ node -v 
   my current version is 25, so nvm install 20 which i successfully installed but had a little prefix not being compatible, which i resolved by nvm use --delete-prefix v20.19.5 and that's all for node installation.

2. Installed SASS globally using npm
   $ npm install -g sass

3. Verified the installation
   $ sass --version

4. SASS is now ready to compile .scss files into .css
